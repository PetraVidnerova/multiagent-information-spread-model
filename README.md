# Installation

All the requirements can be installed using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```console
conda create -n mgraph python=3.8 -y
conda activate mgraph
conda install --file requirements_conda.txt -y
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For other options and/or more help please refer to the [installation instructions](doc/installation.md).

# Usage

All the executable scripts are located in the [scripts](scripts) subfolder. So first of all run:

```console
cd scripts
```

Most of the following commands take as a parameter the name of an INI file. The INI file describes all the configuration
settings and locations of other files used. Please refer to [INI file specification](doc/inifile.md) for details.

There are several INIs provided so that you can base your experiments on these settings:

|filename|description|
|---|---|
|[demo.ini](config/demo.ini)&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>| Very small region (5k inhabitants) for demonstration purposes.|
|[papertown.ini](config/papertown.ini)&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>| Hodoninsko region as referred in paper [[preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.21257139)]|
|[hodoninsko.ini](config/hodoninsko.ini)| Hodonínsko region (57k persons)|
|[lounsko.ini](config/lounsko.ini)| Lounsko region (42k persons)|

<sup>1</sup> All the intermediate outputs of all scripts for `demo.ini` are included in this repository. Therefore you do not
need to run the scripts in the described order.

<sup>2</sup> Graph files of `papertown.ini` are included in this repository. It is not possible to generate this graph
from scratch again by `generate.py` script since several non-public data sources were used for its creation. This graph
was used for experiments presented in our preprints.

### 1. Generation of a graph

Unless you use `papertown` or `demo` graph that are included in this repository, you have to generate your graph. For example:

```console
python generate.py ../config/hodoninsko.ini 
```

would generate a m-graph for Hodonínsko region. For further information please refer to the documentation of
the [generate](doc/generate.md) command.

### 2. Running your experiments

Run your experiment. Note that the first time you run it, the graph is loaded from CSV files, which takes several minutes.

+ If you wish to run one simulation only, use `run_experiment.py`:

```console
python run_experiment.py -r ../config/hodoninsko.ini my_experiment
```

After the run finishes, you should find the file `history_my_experiment.csv` in the directory specified as `output_dir`
in your [INI file](doc/inifile.md#task). The INI files provided use `data/output/model` directory.

+ For a proper experiment, you should evaluate the model more times. You can do it in parallel using:

```console
python run_multi_experiment.py -R ../config/random_seeds.txt --n_repeat=100 --n_jobs=4 ../config/hodoninsko.ini my_experiment
```

By default it produces a ZIP file with the resulting history files. You can change `output_type` to FEATHER and the result
will be stored as one data frame in the feather format. The resulting file is stored in the directory specified
by `output_dir` and it is named `history_my_experiment.zip` or `history_my_experiment.feather`.

### 3. Result visualisation

Now you can create a plot from the resulting files and save it to the path specified by `--out_file PATH_TO_IMG`.

```console
python plot_experiments.py ../data/output/model/history_my_experiment.zip --out_file ./example_img.png
```
